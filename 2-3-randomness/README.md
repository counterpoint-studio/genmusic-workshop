## Exercises

1. Change the sequencer so that instead of always playing a note, it randomly sometimes skips playing a note.
2. Make it so that there's a repeating pattern of random notes.
3. Add a second repeating random pattern, with a different length, one octave above the original one.
4. Randomise the velocity and ADSR envelope of each note a little so that the notes sound different from each other.
5. Introduce “timing humanisation”, by adding small random numbers to the timing of the notes. Try different numbers. When does it sound good? When does it sound too random / unmusical?
