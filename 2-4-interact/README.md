## Exercises

1. Make the notes “brighter” when the energy is higher: Higher pitches, and with higher frequencies on the filter.
2. Make the visual shapes differ based on energy: For example, use brighter colour by playing with the HSL colour saturation and brightness.
3. Add another kind of visualisation, perhaps using smaller shapes, for the melody generators we added in section 2.
