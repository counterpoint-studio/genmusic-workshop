## Exercises

1. Play a second series of notes, with a different pitch and/or sound, corresponding to windy days
2. Adjust the volume (gain) of the notes so that the more sunny/windy it was, the louder they are
3. Play some longer slower notes or samples to announce the change of seasons (beginning of spring, summer, autumn, winter)
4. Change the visualisation so that rainy and windy days show as different colours or shapes
