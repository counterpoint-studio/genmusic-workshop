# Generative Music & Web Audio Workshop

This repository hosts the code examples and exercises for the first day of the [Generative Music workshop](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-connection-by-dotdotdot-generative-music-with-tero-parviainen-796668616277) at Dotdotdot in Milan, 1-2 February 2024.

There is a separate, self-contained directory for each topic that we will discuss during the day. You can go into any of these directories, and run the following commands to start a local server by running

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each of these subdirectories also contains a README file, with some links to relevant documentation on the topic, as well as a set of code exercises. A version of the code with example answers for all of the exercises is also provided (in the directory named `-final`).

You can choose to just start from the intro directory, and do all your work in that same directory through the day. Or, if you want to follow the example structure more closely, or just need to catch up, you can switch working in the corresponding directory for each section.
