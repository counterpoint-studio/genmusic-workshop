# Generative Music & Web Audio Workshop

This repository hosts the code examples and exercises for the first day of the [Generative Music workshop](https://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-connection-by-dotdotdot-generative-music-with-tero-parviainen-796668616277) at Dotdotdot in Milan, 1-2 February 2024.

## Working With The Code

The sections build on top of each other linearly. You can choose to just start from the intro directory, and do all your work in that same directory through the day. Or, if you want to follow the example structure more closely, or just need to catch up, you can switch working in the corresponding directory for each section.

### With Your Own Code Editor And Terminal

To work on the code locally, you will need a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and a code editor.

There is a separate, self-contained directory for each topic that we will discuss during the day. You can go into any of these directories, and run the following commands to start a local server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each of these subdirectories also contains a README file, with some links to relevant documentation on the topic, as well as a set of code exercises. A version of the code with example answers for all of the exercises is also provided (in the directory named `-final`).

### On CodeSandbox

If you'd rather not bother with your own setup of Node.js and and editor, you can do everything fully through your web browser by using the Sandbox links listed below. Each Sandbox will run an editor and a web server, allowing you to run and change the code. When requested, you will need to sign up for a CodeSandbox account. This way you'll be able to also persist your code changes and return to them later.

Each Sandbox also contains a README file, with some links to relevant documentation on the topic, as well as a set of code exercises. A Sandbox version of the code with example answers for all of the exercises is also provided in the list below.
