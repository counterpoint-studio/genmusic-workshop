## Exercises

1. Make 4-5 different repeating loops. Each with a different duration. Each repeating one specific note.
2. Adjust the loop durations and the ADSR envelopes to your liking.
3. Change some or all of the loops to play samples (AudioBufferSourceNode) instead of the synthesizer. You can find a directory of sounds (all in the C major scale) from `public/oneshots`
